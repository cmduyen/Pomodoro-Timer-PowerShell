   📝 No registration or tracking

3. **Deep Work Optimized**  
   🔕 Runs silently in your existing terminal  
   ⏱️ Visual countdown keeps you accountable  
   🔄 Seamless pause/resume for interruptions

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

This implementation follows core Pomodoro technique principles:
- ✅ 25-minute focused work sprints (adjustable)

Studies show the Pomodoro method can:
